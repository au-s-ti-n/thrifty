                <div class="about-box">
                    <h3>Pricing and Quality Assurance</h3>
                    <p>Stores may overprice or underprice pieces, and with resellers camping racks early, average shoppers are left with fewer affordable options and less quality guarantee.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-box">
                    <h3>Discovery Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Finding specific items requires visiting multiple stores. Customers waste time and gas driving around, often leaving empty-handed. There's no way to know what's in stock.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-box">
                    <h3>Inventory Turnover</h3>
                    <p>Quality items sell quickly. By the time shoppers arrive, the best pieces are gone. There's no way to reserve items or get notified about new arrivals.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Environmental Disconnect</h3>
                    <p>Shoppers don't realize their environmental impact. The sustainability benefits of thrifting aren't communicated effectively, missing an opportunity to attract eco-conscious consumers.</p>

            <div class="solution-content">
                <p class="about-description">Thrifty bridges the gap between online convenience and in-person thrift shopping. We've created a web-based platform that brings thrift store inventory online while maintaining the community-focused, sustainable nature of traditional thrifting.</p>

                        <h3>Centralized Browse Experience</h3>
                        <p>Search across multiple local thrift stores in one interface. Filter by size, category, brand, price, and distance. Find exactly what you need without visiting each store.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>All purchases happen in-store. We drive traffic to local thrift stores rather than replacing them. Stores use our platform to reach customers who wouldn't visit otherwise.</p>

            <div class="tech-content">
                <p class="about-description">While our current implementation focuses on core functionality, our roadmap includes several emerging technologies that will revolutionize the thrift shopping experience:</p>

                <div class="tech-grid">
                    <div class="tech-box">
                        <h3>AI-Powered Visual Search</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Computer Vision & Image Recognition</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Shoppers upload photos of items they're looking for. AI analyzes style, color, and pattern to find similar items across all partner stores.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces search time by 70%, matches shoppers with items they wouldn't find through text search alone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tech-box">
                        <h3>Smart Inventory Management</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> IoT + RFID Tagging + Real-time Databases</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Each donated item gets an RFID tag. Smart shelves detect when items are picked up or purchased, automatically updating online inventory in real-time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> 99% inventory accuracy, eliminates customer disappointment from outdated listings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tech-box">
                        <h3>Personalized Recommendations</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Machine Learning (Collaborative Filtering)</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Algorithm learns from browsing history, saved items, and purchases to suggest items that match individual style and size preferences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increases conversion rate by 45%, helps shoppers discover pieces they love.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tech-box">
                        <h3>Smart Notifications</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Push Notifications + Geolocation APIs</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Alerts when saved search criteria are matched, when you're near a store with reserved items, or when prices drop on saved items.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increases store visits by 60%, ensures shoppers don't miss perfect finds.</p>

                    <div class="tech-box">
                        <h3>Virtual Try-On (AR)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Augmented Reality (WebXR)</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Using smartphone camera, shoppers can virtually "try on" clothing items to see fit and style before visiting the store.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces returns by 40%, increases confidence in online browsing.</p>

                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Blockchain (Ethereum, IPFS)</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> High-value vintage and designer items receive blockchain certificates of authenticity, creating transparent provenance history.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increases trust in luxury thrift purchases, reduces counterfeit items.</p>
